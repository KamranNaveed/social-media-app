# KamiSocial

This is a Facebook Clone social media app, developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). The following features are included in the app:

- User authentication: Users can create accounts and log in to the app securely using email and password. Passwords are hashed and salted for added security.
- Post creation: Users can create and share posts with their followers. Posts are stored in a MongoDB database..
- View feed: Users can view a feed of posts from the people they follow and their own posts. The feed is generated by querying the database for posts from followed users.
- View profiles: Users can view the profiles of other users and see their posts and information. Profie information is also stored in the database..
- Follow other users: Users can follow other users and see their posts in their feed. Follow relationships are stored in the database and the feed is updated in real-time.
